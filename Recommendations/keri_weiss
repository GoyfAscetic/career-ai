Keri has been an ace for front end engineering, in all my years working with her. 
She strikes a great balance between delivering value today while making it easier to deliver value going forward.




### Opening
- I've had the pleasure of working with Adam for over three years. 
- Throughout, he’s stood out as a backend lead who not only delivers technically excellent work, but does so in a way that makes life easier for everyone around him.

### Technical
- Adam has a deep understanding of how backend systems support both product goals and user experience. 
- He writes clean, well-structured APIs that are intuitive to consume on the frontend, and always aligned with the broader business context. 
- He asks smart questions, thinks several steps ahead, and consistently ensures that we’re building the right thing - and building it right.

### Interpersonal
- He’s fast, thoughtful, and deeply collaborative. 
- He brings strong opinions to the table but always listens and adapts when others bring good ideas. 
- He communicates clearly, works with care, and genuinely enjoys what he does, which is both obvious and contagious.

### Conclusion
In short, Adam is the kind of engineer who makes a team better, both technically and interpersonally. I’d jump at the chance to work with him again.
