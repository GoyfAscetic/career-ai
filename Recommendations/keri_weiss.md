### Opening
- Keren (aka Keri) has been an ace of front end engineering, in all my years working with her. 
- She strikes a great balance between delivering value today while making it easier to deliver value going forward.

### Technical
- She has quickly learned complicated legacy javascript codebases to deliver emergency performance enhancements
- I've worked with her to iterate and launch brand new products in just 45 days
- Keri has both flagged and rescued projects that gone off track
- She thinks through many UI edge cases that others overlook leading to more complete releases.

### Interpersonal
- She is a constantly using code reviews to help educate other engineers
- She has been the voice of reason in many technical disucssion even when the outcome creates more work for her
- She raises concerns in way that is both timely and calaborative towards a solution that balances  
- She successfuly convinces leadership to adopt new initiatives such as ephemeral enviroments, paying down tech debt, and integrating websockets into the product

### Conclusion
- Even though Keri has not been in the industry a long time, she performs far above what I expect of even Senior Engineers.
- Her ablity to create, design, and communicate her work, is truly special.
- Anyone would be lucky to work with her I hope that someday I may once again be so lucky
