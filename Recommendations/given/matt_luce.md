I had the pleasure of working alongside Matt Luce, and he's an outstanding engineering leader who consistently delivers. Matt excels at enabling seamless external integrations with our platform, ensuring partners and clients can easily access to our services.

One of Matt’s most impressive accomplishments was standardizing access across 40 microservices, significantly simplifying our architecture and boosting our team’s productivity. He also spearheaded a platform-wide upgrade to Spring Boot 3—again, across 40 microservices—demonstrating not just technical expertise but freely sharing that expertise with the engineers.

What sets Matt apart is his ability to provide  effective feedback, even to his peers. His collaborative spirit, technical acumen, and leadership make him an asset to any team.

I highly recommend Matt for any technical leadership or engineering role. He brings both strategic vision and hands-on execution, making a meaningful difference wherever he goes.
