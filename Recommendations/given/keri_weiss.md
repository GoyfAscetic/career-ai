### Opening
- Keren (aka Keri) has been an ace of front end engineering, in all my years working with her. 
- She strikes a great balance between delivering value today while making it easier to deliver value going forward.

### Technical
- She has quickly learned complicated legacy javascript codebases to deliver emergency performance enhancements
- I've worked with her to iterate and launch brand new products in just 45 days
- Keri has both flagged and rescued projects that gone off track
- She thinks through many UI edge cases that others overlook leading to more complete releases.

### Interpersonal
- She is a constantly using code reviews to help educate other engineers
- She has been the voice of reason in many technical disucssion even when the outcome creates more work for her
- She raises concerns in way that is both timely and calaborative towards a solution that balances  
- She successfuly convinces leadership to adopt new initiatives such as ephemeral enviroments, paying down tech debt, and integrating websockets into the product

### Conclusion
- Even though Keri has not been in the industry a long time, she performs far above what I expect of even Senior Engineers.
- Her ablity to create, design, and communicate her work, is truly special.
- Anyone would be lucky to work with her I hope that someday I may once again be so lucky




I had the privilege of working closely with Keri (Keren Weiss) and she is an outstanding front-end engineer who consistently exceeds expectations, even compared to seasoned Senior Engineers.

Keri’s technical skill stands out in every project she touches. She dives into the most complex legacy codebases to deliver critical performance upgrades under tight deadlines. I've seen her guide projects that've gone off track back to the finish line. Keri’s ability to iterate rapidly to deliver production-ready solutions in as little as 45 days is truly impressive. She brings a keen attention to detail, thoughtfully considering UI edge cases that others might miss, which leads to robust, user-friendly releases.

Beyond her technical strengths, Keri is a great mentor. She actively uses code reviews to share knowledge and elevate the entire engineering team. Also, Keri is often the voice of reason in technical discussions, even if it means taking on more work herself. Her communication style is both timely and collaborative, making it easy to work with her toward a solution that works for us all.

Keri has successfully advocated for impactful initiatives such as the adoption of ephemeral environments, prioritization of tech debt, and the integration of websockets. These moments make me appreciate her ability to drive meaningful change beyond her immediate responsibilities.

In short, Keri’s unique combination of technical expertise, leadership, and communication skills make her a tremendous asset to any team. I believe anybody would be lucky to work with her, myself included.
