# NVO Migration
## Staff Engineer
- Architechted a plan to combine account data across 40 databases with a strategy to rollback all changes without trancations
- Experience the entire platform through one account instead of two

# Engineerined a new Data pipeline to improve Contract Progress Accuracy for over 1 million transactions

# Migrating All Customers to new Contract Progress Platform
## Team Lead
- Inherited ownership of a project that was far behind schedule
- Filled in the leadership vaccum created by the departure of the Engineering Manager and Product Manager

# Merging two Microservices
## Team Lead
### Situation
- All 9 Contract Progress Endpoints would consistently crash due to the processing taking too long
### Task
- My team needed to reduce the runtime of these endpoints
### Action
- Indentified that the runtime logic was spread between two microservices connected by an API call with large request and response payloads
- Discovered that one of these microservices only communicated with the other
- So I architeched a plan to merge the two microservices
### Results
- The merge was completed by one engineer in just two weeks
- No disruption to either Microservice's functionality
- All 9 endpoints worst case runtimes dropped from over a minute to a couple of seconds
